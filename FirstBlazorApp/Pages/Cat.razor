<h1>about Cats</h1>
<p>The cat, also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only
    domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication
    of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. </p>
<p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth
    and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat
    communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as
    cat-specific body language. It is a solitary hunter, but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high
    in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It is a predator that is most
    active at dawn and dusk.</p>
<p>Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations
    including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Cats
    also
    communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.</p>
